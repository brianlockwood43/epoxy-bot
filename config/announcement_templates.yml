        Use a friendly, public-facing voice.
        Make it explicit that non-members are welcome as long as they bring good vibes.
        Keep the focus on:
          - what fun events are happening this week,
          - what makes them fun,
          - and exactly how/when to join.
        Include at least one vivid "imagine this..." or similar mini-scenario line.
        Close with:
          - exact start time (Discord timestamp),
          - where to join for comms,
          - and where to ask questions if someone is unsure.

            # Join us for Friday Funday!

            *Friday Funday is your chance to unwind with some comedy racing and fun minigames. It doesn't matter if you're a Lumeris member or not - as long as you bring good vibes, you'll be welcomed with open arms.*

            **:question: What are we doing this week?**

            We have two exciting games planned for this week - Simon Says, and Bowling!!

            =======================

            :checkered_flag: **Minigame 1: Simon Says**

            This one will require you to own the **Hockenheim Ring**.
            We will be racing a super-secret (free) car, all while playing Simon Says.

            > *Just imagine...*
            > Simon Says no brakes allowed!
            > Simon Says drive with one hand!

            Controlled chaos from ridiculous mini-challenges will guarantee a few belly laughs.

            =======================

            :checkered_flag: **Minigame 2 - Bowling**

            You will be put to the test on Lime Rock Park in an F4 car, all while trying to dodge the bowling balls!

            Get ready for a race with a twist. We'll run a seemingly-normal race, but you'll have to weave and turn to avoid the bowling balls, who are trying to take you out!

            *Who will make it through the race without being hit? Join to find out.*

            =======================

            Friday Funday will start at <t:1770316200:t>. Session names and passwords will be posted shortly before the event starts. Make sure to join us in https://discord.com/channels/1408224292604215340/1411275538978308246 for comms and minigame instructions!

            Any questions? Just shoot a DM to @blockwood43 or ask in https://discord.com/channels/1408224292604215340/1408224293120380980 and we'll help you out.

            We look forward to welcoming you on track.
