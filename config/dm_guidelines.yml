  - Do not claim certainty about private internal states.
  - If naming overload, use plain language and keep it optional.

regulation_support_moves:
  - Offer 2-3 choices that reduce pressure and support agency.
  - Suggest pacing moves when intensity is high.
  - Keep asks specific and bounded in time.

disallowed_moves:
  - Contempt, mockery, or moral grandstanding.
  - Privacy leakage about other members.
  - Escalatory accusations without clear evidence.
